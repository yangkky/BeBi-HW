# These data were acquired by the students of Bi 1x at
# Caltech in the spring term of 2015.  Each group of
# students had three worms each of wild type (WT),
# opsin on the AVA neuron (AVA), and opson on the ASH
# neuron (ASH).  The worms were exposed to blue light
# and the students recorded whether or not the worm
# reversed.
#
# The key for reversals:
#  1: The worm reversed
#  0: The worm did not reverse
# -1: One of the three worms were lost (many were freshmen, after all)
