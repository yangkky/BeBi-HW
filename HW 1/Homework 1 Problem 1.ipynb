    "Goals for Kevin Yang:\n",
    "My goal for this class is to learn the principals of Bayesian statistics and data analysis. Through lecture, reading, tutorial, and practice, I would like to learn how to apply a principled approach to analyzing and interpreting data. My professor has asked me, as one of two engineering students currently in the group, to become a resource for quantitative analysis to the rest of the group, and this class is one step towards fulfilling that role. In the longer term, I want to work on problems at the intersection of biology, engineering, and statistics, and the material in this class is relevant to that intersection. Finally, I would like to develop my skill and familiarity with Python, increasing my ability to both quickly write functional code and to write well-documented production code. "
